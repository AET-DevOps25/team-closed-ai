# üìù Problem Statement
Include:

* What is the main functionality?
* Who are the intended users?
* How will you integrate GenAI meaningfully?
* Describe some scenarios how your app will function?

Our application helps project managers and developers organize their projects and tasks more efficiently. It features a user-friendly, kanban-style interface that makes it easy to create, update, and delete tasks.

The application also includes a built-in chat powered by a Generative AI. The chat bot can analyze user input and project-related files to suggest new tasks, provide summaries, and answer project related questions. This integration makes it easier for users to get started on new projects, stay organized, and receive relevant task recommendations.

Intended users include project managers, developers, and students who need to manage projects and tasks. The application is designed to be user-friendly and accessible, making it suitable for both experienced project managers and those new to project management.

**Use Scenarios**:
1. Alice and her team participate in the DevOps course at TUM. They have a great idea for a project but are unsure how to organize their tasks. In the second project week, they are required to create a backlog of tasks. Alice's team decides to use the Project Management Application by ClosedAI. They create a new project and begin adding tasks to the backlog using the kanban board.

2. Bob joins a project that already has a backlog and several uploaded documents, such as requirements and project plans. He's unsure where to begin, so he opens the app and asks the chat what the project is about. The AI analyzes the files and provides him with a summary. He then tells the chat bot that he is new to the team but has some experience with React. Based on this additional information, he asks for task recommendations, and the chat suggests tasks aligned with his skills and experience. Bob chooses a task and assigns it to himself.

3. Charlie is a solo developer who has collected project requirements and use cases from his new client. He has a lot of project related files but is unsure how to get started. He visits the Project Management Application, creates a new project, and uploads his project related files. He then asks in the chat for recommendations on new tasks. The chat bot analyzes the project related files and provides Charlie with a backlog of tasks that he can add to the kanban board. Charlie is not happy with the recommendations and asks the chat bot to provide him with more specific tasks. The chat bot refines its recommendations, and Charlie drags the tasks he wants directly from the chat into the board.
