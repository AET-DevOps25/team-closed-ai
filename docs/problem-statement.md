# Generative AI Project Management Application

Our application helps project managers and developers organize their projects and tasks more efficiently. It features a user-friendly, kanban-style interface that makes it easy to create, update, and delete tasks.

The application also includes a built-in chat powered by a Generative AI. The chat bot can analyze user input, the project description and project related tasks to either suggest new tasks, or answer project related questions. This integration makes it easier for users to get started on new projects, stay organized, and receive relevant task recommendations.

Intended users include project managers, developers, and students who need to manage projects and tasks. The application is designed to be user-friendly and accessible, making it suitable for both experienced project managers and those new to project management.

## Use Scenarios

1. Alice and her team participate in the DevOps course at TUM. They have a great idea for a project but are unsure how to organize their tasks. In the second project week, they must create a backlog of tasks. Alice's team decides to use the Project Management Application by ClosedAI. They create a new project and begin adding tasks to the backlog using the kanban board.

2. Bob joins a project that already has a backlog and several tasks. He's unsure where to begin, so he opens the app and asks the chat bot what the project is about. The AI analyzes the tasks and project description and provides him with a summary. He then tells the chat bot that he is new to the team but has some experience with React. Based on this additional information, he asks for task recommendations, and the chat suggests tasks aligned with his skills and experience. Bob chooses a task and assigns it to himself.

3. Charlie is a solo developer who has collected project requirements and use cases from his new client. He has a lot of project related information but is unsure how to get started. He visits the Project Management Application, creates a new project, and adds this inforamtion to the project's description. He then asks in the chat for recommendations on new tasks. The chat bot analyzes the project description and provides Charlie with a backlog of tasks that he can add to the kanban board. Charlie is happy with the recommendations and adds the task recommendations to the board with a single click.
